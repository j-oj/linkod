## Making Commits

### 1. Cloning branch:

- git clone `link of github-repo`

### 2. Before making changes in dev-branch:

```
- git checkout dev-branch     // go to dev-branch
- git pull origin staging        // merges staging branch with current branch
- git push                    // push changes to the cloud
```

Doing these 3 commands ensures you are updated to the latest version of the main branch. You may now make changes to the code.

### 3. After making changes in dev-branch:

**Commit and push changes to dev-branch with commit message in the vscode git GUI**

```
- git pull origin staging          // merges staging branch with current branch
- git push                      // push changes to the cloud
```

### 4. Make a PR from your dev-branch to staging.
